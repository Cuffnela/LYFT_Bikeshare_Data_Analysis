# LYFT Bikeshare Query Project

This is a theoretical query project completed during the UC Berkeley MIDS program.
  The project focuses on utilizing SQL through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery to answer business-driven
  questions using public datasets housed in GCP. Queries were complete through the web UI (BigQuery)
  and query command-line tools through the GCP terminal and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Original Problem Statement

You're a data scientist at Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels), formerly known as Ford GoBike, the
  company running Bay Area Bikeshare. You are trying to increase ridership, and
  you want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so. 
  
What deals do you offer though? Currently, your company has several options which can change over time.  Please visit the website to see the current offers and other marketing information. Frequent offers include: 
  * Single Ride 
  * Monthly Membership
  * Annual Membership
  * Bike Share for All
  * Access Pass
  * Corporate Membership
  * etc.

Through this project, you will answer these questions: 

  * What are the 5 most popular trips that you would call "commuter trips"? 
  
  * What are your recommendations for offers (justify based on your findings)?

You won't find a column in a table labeled "commuter trip".  You will find you need to do quite a bit of data exploration using SQL queries to determine your own definition of a communter trip.  In data exploration process, you will find a lot of dirty data, that you will need to either clean or filter out. You will then write SQL queries to find the communter trips.

Likewise to make your recommendations, you will need to do data exploration, cleaning or filtering dirty data, etc. to come up with the final queries that will give you the supporting data for your recommendations. You can make any recommendations regarding the offers, including, but not limited to: 
  * market offers differently to generate more revenue 
  * remove offers that are not working 
  * modify exising offers to generate more revenue
  * create new offers for hidden business opportunities you have found
  * etc. 

#### All Work MUST be done in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) / The Majority of Work MUST be done using BigQuery SQL / Usage of Temporary Tables, Views, Pandas, Data Visualizations

You can make intermediate temporary tables or views in your own dataset in BigQuery as you like.  Actually, this is a great way to work!  These make data exploration much easier.  It's much easier when you have made temporary tables or views with only clean data, filtered rows, filtered columns, new columns, summary data, etc.  If you use intermediate temporary tables or views, you should include the SQL used to create these, along with a brief note mentioning that you used the temporary table or view.

In the final Jupyter Notebook, the results of your BigQuery SQL will be read into Pandas, where you will use the skills you learned in the Python class to print formatted Pandas tables, simple data visualizations using Seaborn / Matplotlib, etc.  You can use Pandas for simple transformations, but please remember the bulk of work should be done using Google BigQuery SQL.

## Project Components 

- In Part 1, Google BigQuery GUI interface in the cloud.

- In Part 2, Linux command line from our virtual machine in the cloud.

- In Part 3, Jupyter Notebook in our virtual machine in the cloud, save the results into Pandas, and present a report enhanced by Pandas output tables and simple data visualizations using Seaborn / Matplotlib.

## Data Sets

Public Datasets: Bring up your Google BigQuery console, open the menu for the public datasets, and navigate to the the dataset san_francisco.

- The Bay Bike Share has two datasets: a static one and a dynamic one.  The static one covers an historic period of about 3 years.  The dynamic one updates every 10 minutes or so.  

- Static tables we will be using are in the dataset **san_francisco** :

  * bikeshare_stations

  * bikeshare_status

  * bikeshare_trips

- The dynamic tables are found in the dataset **san_francisco_bikeshare**
